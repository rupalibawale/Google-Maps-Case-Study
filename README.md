I participated in a Product Management challenge hosted by PM School (https://pmschool.io/ChallengeDetails?state=past&id=66914013e556ac3d56f0f0ec), where I took on the role of VP of Product at Google Maps. The challenge was to propose new features for Google Maps, a product with over 1 billion monthly active users. The task was to address key user pain points and create improvements without drastically altering the familiar interface.


Challenge Details

The primary objectives were to:

    Identify key pain points for Google Maps users, such as confusion between similar-looking roads and enhancing the navigation experience for both car drivers and two-wheeler riders.
    Propose three new features that could seamlessly integrate into the current app interface.
    Prioritize these features based on user impact and ease of implementation.
    Develop a monetization strategy to capitalize on these new features.
    Design wireframes using tools like Balsamiq and Figma to visually represent the solutions.
    Define success metrics to measure the effectiveness of the new features once implemented.
